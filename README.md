# cf_ai_llm-chatbot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot application deployed on Cloudflare Workers AI, using the Llama 3.3 model. It is built upon the official Cloudflare `llm-chat-app-template` and customized to demonstrate AI workflows, chat interaction, and memory/state management within the Cloudflare ecosystem.

## Features
- Powered by llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast on Cloudflare Workers AI (via remote API)
- Workflow and coordination using Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects
- User input via chat interface (Cloudflare Pages)
- Basic conversation memory/state retention
- Deployed on Cloudflare Workers and accessible via provided link


### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MeilingLiu1997/cf_ai_llm-chatbot.git
   cd cf_ai_llm-chatbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate Worker type definitions:
   ```bash
   npm run cf-typegen
   ```

## Demo

Deployed on the CloudFlare: https://cf_ai_llm-chatbot.mliu1223.workers.dev

<!-- dash-content-end -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- A Cloudflare account with Workers AI access


### Development

Start a local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:8787.

Note: Using Workers AI accesses your Cloudflare account even during local development, which will incur usage charges.

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Monitor

View real-time logs associated with any deployed Worker:

```bash
npm wrangler tail
```

## How It Works

### Backend

The backend is built with Cloudflare Workers and uses the Workers AI platform to generate responses. The main components are:

1. **API Endpoint** (`/api/chat`): Accepts POST requests with chat messages and streams responses
2. **Streaming**: Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming of AI responses
3. **Workers AI Binding**: Connects to Cloudflare's AI service via the Workers AI binding

### Frontend

The frontend is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application that:

1. Presents a chat interface
2. Sends user messages to the API
3. Processes streaming responses in real-time
4. Maintains chat history on the client side

## Customization

### Changing the Model

To use a different AI model, update the `MODEL_ID` constant in `src/index.ts`. You can find available models in the [Cloudflare Workers AI documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).

### Using AI Gateway

The template includes commented code for AI Gateway integration, which provides additional capabilities like rate limiting, caching, and analytics.

To enable AI Gateway:

1. [Create an AI Gateway](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/ai-gateway) in your Cloudflare dashboard
2. Uncomment the gateway configuration in `src/index.ts`
3. Replace `YOUR_GATEWAY_ID` with your actual AI Gateway ID
4. Configure other gateway options as needed:
   - `skipCache`: Set to `true` to bypass gateway caching
   - `cacheTtl`: Set the cache time-to-live in seconds

Learn more about [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/).

### Modifying the System Prompt

The default system prompt can be changed by updating the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` constant in `src/index.ts`.

### Styling

The UI styling is contained in the `<style>` section of `public/index.html`. You can modify the CSS variables at the top to quickly change the color scheme.
